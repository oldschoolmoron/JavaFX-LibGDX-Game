# 🚀 Space Shooter (JavaFX)

A beginner-friendly 2D **Space Shooter** game built using **Java and JavaFX**.  
This is a learning project to explore **game loops**, **rendering**, **keyboard input**, and **object-oriented structure** in Java.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Main.java**
    - Creates the JavaFX window and canvas
    - Initializes the `Game` class
    - Starts the animation timer (game loop)

2. **Game.java**
    - Handles the update/render cycle
    - Manages player, enemies, and bullets
    - Processes keyboard input

3. **Player.java**
    - Defines player properties like position and speed
    - Contains movement and drawing logic

4. **Enemy.java** *(upcoming)*
    - Will define enemy properties and AI behavior

5. **Bullet.java** *(upcoming)*
    - Will handle projectiles fired by the player or enemies

## 💬 About This Project

This is my personal learning project.  
I’m building it step-by-step to understand how real-time games work in Java — from drawing shapes on a canvas to managing player movement, collisions, and game logic.
